Interested in using AI to generate medical cases? >  [See tool 3.3](https://canvas.maastrichtuniversity.nl/courses/23475/pages/3-dot-3-using-ai-to-generate-medical-cases "🟧 3.3 - Using AI to Generate Medical Cases")

----------

#### **Step 1: Search and select an appropriate case**

The following resources provide medical cases for learning. Please be aware that cases might not entirely fit with you current APT or focus-APT, so maintain a critical attitude towards complexity and required depth of understanding. Also, cases from other settings might differ in health care options and choices made. Cases can be presented as text, video and/or can be accompanied with illustrations or imaging.

**A) Resources available through UM University Library**.  _Use your vpn/UM login to access!_

-   [AccessMedicine](https://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/), case files collection
    -   Available via University Library, search for AccessMedicine in  _databases_.
    -   Within AccessMedicine, choose “cases” from the menu ribbon.
-   [ClinicalKey](https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/search/clinical%20cases)
    -   Available via University Library, search for ClinicalKey in  _databases_.
    -   Within ClinicalKey, type “clinical cases” as a search term.

-   [Virtual interactive case system](https://pie.med.utoronto.ca/VIC/VIC_content/VIC_familyMedicine.html)
    -   Toronto General Hospital (CAN)

#### **Step 2a: Discuss the case (learning team meeting)**

_Preparation_

The student(s) who are in charge of delivering the case, should  **screen**  and if necessary  **edit**  the selected case before presenting it to the team:

-   Check for  **redundant**  or  **distracting information**, or information that goes beyond the level of complexity that is needed. Remove or strikethrough this information to simplify the case and have a better focussed discussion.
-   Most existing cases will be accompanied by an answer key /  **solution**  Bring this information to the meeting, but do not share with your peers yet. Use this info to guide the discussion.
-   When you use an AI-generated case: Make a best possible judgement of its  **plausibility**. If necessary, adjust. See also  **tool 4.8**

_Discussion_

Discussing the case is a way to delve deep into the underlying mechanisms. Some ground rules:

-   The student(s) who present the case, also  **guide**  the discussion. They take the role of coach and are allowed to make use of the answer key to steer the group towards finding the correct solution.
-   Make sure  **everyone contributes**  to discussion.
-   **Invite each other**  to ask questions about any aspects you do not yet understand properly.
-   Explain  **in your own words**. You may want to use your notes as a reminder, but do not read out loud.
-   When others are speaking,  **check for yourself**  if it is clear what is being said, and if it is true in your opinion.

_Guiding questions_

The following guiding questions might be useful to discuss the case. These questions are for inspiration; feel free to adapt, omit or add as you see fit for purpose. (Often a case comes with a set of questions that of course can be used as well)

-   Explain the case – from a  **basic science**  perspective
    -   Can you explain the underlying mechanisms? (Patho/physiology, anatomy, pharmacology, psychology, etc.)
    -   Any points you do not understand?
    -   Use the whiteboard to produce drawings to support your explanation.
-   Explain the case – from a  **clinical** perspective
    -   Can you explain all complaints and symptoms?
    -   Can you explain the choices and decisions made (concerning further evaluation, management, follow-up)?
    -   Any points you do not understand?
    -   Any points to be critical about?

-   Embrace diversity, and ask one or more  **“what if”**  questions: “What if this patient was/had….”
    -   a different age
    -   a different gender/sex
    -   a different educational background
    -   a different socio-economic background
    -   a different lifestyle
    -   ….
-   Did any  **new questions**  arise during the discussion? > Food for further study!

#### **Step 2b: Use the case for self-evaluation**

If you use the case for self-evaluation, go through the guiding questions listed above and try to answer them. Formulate your own answer  **_before_**  checking the answer key that comes with the case.

# 🟧 3.3 - Using AI to Generate Medical Cases

## **A tool to create cases to challenge your knowledge**

----------

#### **How to use this tool?**

This tool can be used within the learning team and/or for self-study.  
**Step 1:**  Create an appropriate case using AI.  
For use in a learning team meeting, one or two students could be assigned the task to create a case and bring it to the meeting. The tool guides you how to create them.  
**Step 2:**  Discuss the case within your learning team or use the case for self-evaluation. ([See tool 3.2](https://canvas.maastrichtuniversity.nl/courses/23475/pages/3-dot-2-using-medical-cases-for-deep-learning "🟧 3.2 - Using Medical Cases for Deep Learning")  for directions how to use medical cases for deep learning).

----------

#### **Step 1: Generate a medical case using AI (Chat-GPT)**

· What it can do: ChatGPT can create full cases, vignettes, and lab results instantly and to match almost any desired parameters. For a full case, it will give demographics, chief complaint, physical exam results, diagnostics, and possible diagnoses. For a case vignette, it will give complaint, history, vitals, and physical examination.  
· What it can’t do: ChatGPT may not retrieve accurate information as it “makes up” the case. Cases will have to be checked thoroughly for inaccuracies. This point may also be taken into the discussion.  
· Sample prompts:  
o “Create a case vignette for an adult found in an acute emergency on the street with an ABC problem”  
o “Create a case vignette for an adult with difficulty breathing.”  
o “Generate a case that could be difficult to distinguish between pneumonia or lung cancer.”  
· Caution when using ChatGPT: ChatGPT can be a valuable tool, but caution should be taken when using it, especially in healthcare and healthcare education. When faced with lacking or ambiguous information, ChatGPT may create fictional responses, sometimes called “hallucinations.” This can be especially problematic for advanced applications involving diagnoses or complicated cases. For this reason, medical students using ChatGPT should be aware of its limitations.  
o Always verify the plausibility and accuracy of any information you use from ChatGPT such as cases or vignettes.  
o Use the discussion to clarify any misconceptions, mistakes, or omissions in information in ChatGPTs output.  
o Suggestions made by ChatGPT may not be evidence-based because ChatGPT uses the entire internet as a source, not just peer-reviewed scientific material. Expertise as a (trainee) clinician must be applied to responses from ChatGPT.

####   
**Step 2: Discuss the case (learning team meeting) or use the case for self-evaluation**  
**Preparation**

The student(s) who are in charge of delivering the case, should screen and if necessary edit the created case before presenting it to the team:  
· Check for redundant or distracting information, or information that goes beyond the level of complexity that is needed. Remove or strikethrough this information to simplify the case and have a better focussed discussion.  
· When you use an AI-generated case: Make a best possible judgement of its plausibility. If necessary, adjust.

# 🟧 3.4 - Using AI to generate (Progress Test) practice questions

## **A tool to generate practice questions with Chat-GPT and use these for deep learning and self-monitoring**

----------

#### **How to use this tool?**

This tool provides a prompt script to generate practice questions on a specific topic using Chat-GPT. You may find this helpful to expand your collection of questions for self-evaluation purposes and to practice specific content topics, for example your weaker progress test categories. You can use the questions for retrieval practice (e.g. include them in flashcards) to enhance your deep learning and for self-monitoring purposes to evaluate your study efforts.

The steps below guide you through the AI process in a way that delivers best-available quality questions, a separate answer key and references for further study. Also tips are provided to get the most out of you practice sessions.

----------

#### **Step 1: Go to Multiple Choice Question Generator for Education**

A dedicated Chat-GPT application was developed to generate multiple choice questions for education. We advise you to use this generator, as it is trained to deliver questions for learning purposes in a state of the art format. You can access the application through the following link:

[https://chatgpt.com/g/g-ZKcU5Y61H-multiple-choice-question-generator-education](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-ZKcU5Y61H-multiple-choice-question-generator-education)

#### **Step 2: Use prompt part 1 to generate questions**

Copy and paste the prompt text below (in orange) into the GPT’s chat box; adapt the topic to your needs (here the topic musculoskeletal anatomy is used as an example). Explanation and tips:

-   Sub 1: The addition “clinical applied” results in more relevant, application of knowledge type questions. Formulate the topic as precise as possible. This might needs some experimenting.
-   Sub 1: Of course the number of questions can be adjusted to your liking (where high numbers are more likely to produce redundant questions).
-   Sub 2: The difficulty level can be adjusted by adjusting the percentages. This is however just a rough indicator.
-   Sub 4: Including a short clinical vignette produces Progress test type questions.

_Prompt text part 1:_

Create a test about clinical applied human anatomy of the musculoskeletal system, conform the following criteria:

-   The tests consists of 20 multiple-choice questions with a mix of three to six answer options.
-   Difficulty level of the questions should be 50% moderate and 50% difficult for final year undergraduate medical students.
-   Create the multiple-choice questions conform scientifically recognized methodology.
-   In the question stem use a short clinical vignette.
-   Present answer options in alphabetical order.
-   Present per question in this order: question – answer options. Do NOT include answer key.
-   Layout: insert a horizontal line between questions. Put enter between question and answer and between answer options.

_Copy-paste the output in a word file and save._

#### **Step 3: Use prompt part 2 to generate answer key**

Next, use the prompt text part 2 (in orange) to generate an extensive answer key. Do this immediately after step 2, in the same GPT chat session. Keeping the answer key separate from the questions enhances the learning experience if you want to use the questions to really test yourself.

_Prompt text part 2:_

Next, provide an answer key list with for each question the following information:

-   answer key
-   explanation for correct answer
-   a verifiable reference of a textbook, not journal, commonly accepted in medical education, including exact title of the specific resource and page number(s).
-   Layout: insert a horizontal line between entries.

_Copy-paste the output in a word file and save__._

#### **Step 4: Practice! – Tips & tricks**

Of course, the next step is to use the generated questions to enhance your content knowledge. Here are some tips to optimize your learning by actively studying with multiple-choice practice questions:

-   Cover the answer options, try to answer the question as an “open question”.
-   Do not focus only on selecting/recognizing the correct answer option; also try to explain why this is the correct answer, include (patho)physiological mechanisms, pathways, anatomy, etc. Use paper and pencil and challenge yourself to work it out in a schematic, concept map, etc.
-   To extend along the same line, also explain why the other answer options are incorrect. To further challenge yourself: When (in which scenario or variation of the question stem) would answer X be a correct answer?
-   Go back to the original question: You can create further variations by asking yourself “What if….?” > How would the answer change, if… > different age, gender, geographical location, clinical setting, symptoms, etc.
-   Include the questions in a flash cards deck to keep practicing regularly (retrieval practice).
