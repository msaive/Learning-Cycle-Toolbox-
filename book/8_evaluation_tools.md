# ⚪ TEAM EVALUATION TOOLS :: I want to do a team evaluation

### **What are these tools?**

These tools provide suggestions for evaluation formats that can be used to evaluate the group dynamics, collaboration and work processes in the learning team.

### **Why are these tools useful?**

For learning teams to work effectively, everyone should feel safe and comfortable in the group. Also effectiveness of work processes, and steps to take the collaboration to a next level are aspects to review and reflect on together on a regular basis. These evaluations may also provide individual students with input for further growth as collaborator, leader or communicator (for example: how take your role as discussion leader to a next level).

### **When to use these tools?**

These tools are specifically designed to be used during evaluation moments. You are free to together determine when to do this; we recommend to evaluate team functioning at least once every period and sooner whenever needed.

# ⬜ 8.2 - Blobtree Evaluation

## **A tool to evaluate learning team functioning**

----------

#### **How to use this tool?**

This tool can be used to evaluate team functioning within the learning team and/or within 1-on-1 meetings with the LTC.  
The Blobtree is a visual tool that you -  **students and coaches alike**  - can use to start a conversation about group functioning.  
_“The Blobs are neither male nor female, young nor old, European nor African, ancient nor modern. They are outside of culture. Blobs are the best of us and the worst of us. They don’t tell us what we ought to do, or what we mustn’t do…they merely show us how a variety of people feel. Without words, the Blobs can be interpreted in a hundred different ways. There is no right and wrong about the Blobs, which is very important.”_  
Excerpt from  [https://www.blobtree.com/pages/frontpage](https://www.blobtree.com/pages/frontpage)

----------

#### **Suggested questions**

Use the blobtree picture on the next page to print out and discuss. All kind of questions can be asked, for example:  
· Which blob depicts you in our learning team, and why?  
> Do others agree? Do they see you differently?  
· Which blob according to you, best depicts our LTC, and why?  
> Does the group agree? Are there different ideas?  
· To what extent does the blobtree represent our team as a whole?  
> What analogies do you see? In what areas can we grow, as a team?  
· Adapt the questions to your liking and needs, be creative!
