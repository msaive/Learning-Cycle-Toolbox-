# ⬜ 7.1 - How to structure a learning team meeting

## **Basic structure for learning team meetings**

----------

#### **Purpose of the learning team meeting**

The purpose of learning team meetings is to actively engage with the period’s  **learning content**. The format adheres to the  **Problem Based Learning**  principles of collaborative, contextual, constructive and self-regulated learning. A learning team meeting lasts 2 hours. The first hour is dedicated to  **discussing learning tasks**  and promoting  **deep learning**  of the period content and is supervised by the learning team coach (LTC). The second hour is protected time for the team to work coach-independent on  **group assignments**  or extended collaborative learning initiatives.

#### **How to use this tool?**

This tool provides a  **basic structure**  for the  **learning team meetings**. It includes a list of  **suggested activities**, from which you (= the team) can make a choice. **Teams develop their own practice, so please be creative and experiment with new formats as well.** What works for one team, does not have to work for another team, so let’s embrace this diversity! And remember: The  _students_  are in charge of the learning team program and should fulfil leading roles in the learning team meeting content and process.

----------

#### **General structure of a learning team meeting: segments-approach**

A general guideline to structure your learning team meetings, is to divide the session in  **segments of 10 min,** as this will result in a well-structured meeting, allowing for several activities within a single meeting.  Next, decide on the activities for each segment. Most activities may require 2 or 3 segments to be combined.

An example for a first hour:

-   00-10: “Open floor” for any questions
-   10-40: Post-discussion difficulties from previous learning task(s)
-   40-50: A short expert presentation by one of the team members
-   50-60: other business / setting agenda for next meeting

Or:

-   00-20: Concept mapping “Focus-APT zoom in / zoom out”
-   20-50: Pre-discussion next learning tasks(s)
-   50-60: Quiz on specific Progress Test category

An example for a second hour:

-   00-10: Updates on progress group work
-   10-30: Work on specific part tasks (in subgroups)
-   30-50: Report back, combine and integrate parts
-   50-60: Next steps and agreements

Or:

-   00-30: Peer Q&A on anatomy practical
-   30-50: Formulate and submit questions for upcoming expert meeting
-   50-60: Looking ahead and refining meeting agenda for next week(s)

Your team might develop several  **variations**  to this time schedule, for example a specific one for the first meeting of a period, a dedicated evaluation session, etc. In the next section of this tool, suggested activities for different types of segments are provided. This is not an exhaustive list, so feel free to experiment and add your own formats.

**Tip:**  Regarding planning, look further ahead than the next meeting. As a team create a  **period plan**, roughly outlining what you want to do when. As each meeting gets closer, you can adjust or make the agenda segments more specific.

----------

#### **A - Topics and activities for “first hour” segments (with LTC)**

**A1. OPEN FLOOR**

-   **Round-up**

Just an informal round: How is everyone doing today?

-   **The helpdesk**

Low-threshold opportunity to ask and answer any short questions for peer support.

-   **Energizer / Conversations starter / Get to know each other game**

Spend a few minutes to get to know each other better. Browse the internet for any short conversation starter or get-to-know-each-other games. Keep it short and sweet: take turns, spread out over several meetings, etc.

-   **Open mic**

One student in the spotlight, sharing anything you want. May be mini-presentations or other performances, related to curriculum contents or beyond (hobbys, personal interests).

**A2. PRE-DISCUSSION LEARNING TASKS**

This topic fits with the “Task analysis” step in the learning cycle and is therefore essential to include frequently. Aim is to explore APT, focus-APT or learning task and activate your prior knowledge. Don’t forget: To conclude the pre-discussion, formulate specific  **learning goals**  for self-study.

-   **Brainstorming**

See  **tool 1.1**  for guiding questions to explore the APT (at start of period).

-   **Concept mapping**

See  **tool 1.2**  for a guideline on how to create a concept map about the APT, which you can revisit throughout the period. Also when exploring a focus-APT or specific learning task, using the whiteboard or an online concept mapping tool is recommended to structure your exploration.

-   **De slimste mens / The smartest human (a Dutch TV quiz)**

In this quiz show, a recurring question format is:  _“What do you know about…..[topic]?”_  . The respondent gets 2 min. time to mention as many as possible facts or associations with the topic.

**A3. POST-DISCUSSION LEARNING TASKS**

This topic serves a purpose to enhance deep learning. Explaining to others in your own words what you have learned during your self-study, is an effective method to consolidate your knowledge. Of course this also an opportunity to ask questions to your peers about difficult topics. Finally, applying what you have learned to new situations is a good test to see whether you are on track.

-   **Concept mapping**

Use the whiteboard to share what you have learned. Visualize the learning content with schematics, drawings, etc. Ideal for delving deeper into basic sciences, such as the details of structures, processes, etc. Explain in your own words, without using notes. And of course, everyone contributes.

-   **Be the expert**

One of the students takes on the expert role and presents about a specific learning goal. Agree beforehand on presentation mode, max. duration, number of slides, etc. Keep it concise and to-the-point. The aim of this activity is NOT to show off with exotic details, but to help your peers to understand the topic.

-   **Q&A on learning goals**

Do not miss this opportunity to use the team to find answers to your content matter related questions. What was difficult or unclear? Which aspects did you struggle with?

-   **Team quiz**

Develop your own quiz questions and play! Possibilities are endless, so be creative, yet keep a few ground rules in mind:

-   -   Questions should be on essentials, not exotic details. Don’t ask questions you do not want to be confronted with in a formal test yourself.
    -   Always check and discuss the correctness of answer options and solutions. Don’t take them for granted! If you notice an incorrect answer, speak up.
    -   Preferably implement quizzes in a team style. Make duo’s or split the team in two halves for gaming purposes. Avoid only few students giving all the answers, find a way to also include the quieter team members.

-   -   When working with multiple choice questions: Do not only focus on giving the correct answer; explaining and understanding why the other answering options are wrong is as challenging.

-   **Zoom in, zoom out**

To put single learning tasks into perspective, relate them to the focus-APT and/or main APT. See  **tool 3**  for a guideline.

-   **Case-based discussion**

Put your newly gained knowledge to the test by trying to apply it to a new case. See  **tool 4.1.3**  for guidelines and suggestions on how to find or design cases.

**A4. EXPERT MEETINGS**

You may want to spend some time in the learning team to prepare for or post-discuss expert meetings. Pitfall: Do not let the expert meetings dominate your learning team meetings, your focus should be on the learning tasks. Yet, some team activities might support your personal preparation for expert meetings and the integration of expert meetings with learning tasks.

-   **Forward remaining questions**

Unanswered questions may remain during learning team discussions. Forward these questions pro-actively to upcoming expert meetings. Submit them well in advance on behalf of your team.

-   **Submit questions**

Plan individual preparation for expert meetings in such a way that you can use learning team meeting time to discuss the subject matter and together submit questions for the expert. Focus your questions on essentials, related to the intended learning outcomes. This is not about showing off your own knowledge to the expert; ask the questions you hope others would submit.

-   **Digest together**

After an expert meeting, use some time to digest together what you have learned. What were the key messages? How do these relate to the focus-APT and learning tasks? How does it relate to your discussions in the learning team? Try to help each other clarifying any remaining unclarities.

**A5. EVALUATION ACTIVITIES**

Evaluate your team functioning and group dynamics at least twice per period. There are several tools in the toolbox for evaluation formats: See  **tools 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3**.

----------

#### **B – Topics and activities for “second hour” segments (without LTC)**

**B1. GROUP ASSIGNMENTS**

Work on group assignments will generally be defined by the specific assignment’s requirements and practicalities. For group work to be effective, focus your time segments on specific goals:

-   **Exploring the task**

Does everyone understand what you are expected to do? What will be the timeline and deadlines? What deliverables should you produce? What personal learning goals do team members want to work on (in terms of content, collaboration, etc.)?

-   **Brainstorming**

Spend time on brainstorming about task approach and content options.

-   **Work on part-tasks**

Use your time to work out the actual assignment. You might likely divide tasks or work in duo’s / subgroups. Sit together, work on your part, instead of postponing it to another time/place.

-   **Report and integrate**

Group work should be more than just dividing the workload. Spend time to discuss, combine and integrate the parts. This helps you get the most out of the assignment in terms of learning, and moreover it benefits the quality of the final product.

-   **Next steps**

Do not end the meeting before making and communicating clear and concrete plans for next steps. Divide tasks and agree on the planning. Make sure everyone is on board and knows what to do.

**B2. LEARNING TOGETHER**

Extend activities from the first hour and spend more time to study together. Choose from the formats listed for the first hour; many of those are also suitable to do without the learning team coach. In addition, you might opt to:

-   **Work on preparations for practicals, workshops, expert meetings**

Stay in the room and study together. Work individually or in small groups (duo’s) and take advantage of the concentration synchrony and easy access to help for upcoming questions.

-   **How do you…..?**

# ⬜ 7.2.1 - Conversation guide regular 1-on-1 meetings

## **Agenda points and guiding questions for short individual coaching meetings throughout a period (Act phase)**

----------

#### **Purpose of the 1-on-1 meetings**

1-on-1 meetings are designed to be  **brief individual coaching sessions**  (15-20 min.) throughout the year. The goal is to provide/make use of “real-time” coaching on the  **daily learning process**. Therefore, these meetings should occur with a high frequency, at least  **once every 2-3 weeks**.

-   In terms of the learning cycle, throughout a period the focus in these meetings is on the  **performance (“act”) phase**.
-   Towards the end of a period, focus temporarily shifts towards the  **self-reflection (“look back”) and forethought (“plan”) phases**  (see tool 7.2.2).

Aim at keeping sessions short and sweet; spreading out the topics to discuss may be a way to achieve this.

#### **How to use this tool**

This tool provides a  **basic structure**  and  **guiding questions**  for the  **1-on-1 meetings during a period**. It includes a list of  **topics that require ongoing attention throughout the academic year**. Do not aim to cover them all in detail in one session but use this list for your review and distribute the topics across your short 1-on-1 meetings in a personalized approach to coaching.  **Monitor**  and  **follow-up**  on relevant topics frequently.

For end-of-period 1-on-1meeting >  [See Tool 7.2.2](https://canvas.maastrichtuniversity.nl/courses/23475/pages/7-dot-2-2-conversation-guide-end-of-period-1-on-1-meeting "🗨️ 7.2.2 - Conversation guide end-of-period 1-on-1 meeting")

----------

#### **Basic structure and guiding questions for the 1-on-1 meeting**

**1 PERSONAL WELLBEING**

-   How are you doing?
-   Are there any new documents in your  **correspondence folder**  of your portfolio which we should discuss?

**2 STUDY PROGRESS (“REALTIME” MONITORING)**

-   How is your study  **progress** in this period, are you on track? How do you know?
-   How do you use  **self-evaluations and other performance data**?
-   Which personal  **learning goals**  are your working on? What progress did you make so far?

> Add update in portfolio

**3 STUDY STRATEGIES (WORKING WITH LEARNING CONTENT)**

-   How does your  **self-study**  work-out so far? What are your  **strategies**  to study the learning tasks? To what extent are these strategies  **effective for deep learning**? Does your self-study strategy need adjustment? How? What would you need to make this successful? Tip: review  **Study Smart**  materials for more information on effective learning strategies.
-   How are you  **preparing**  for and  **participating**  in  **expert meetings, trainings, workshops**?

**4 ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION**

-   Are you  **attending** all learning activities? If not, why? Although this is a SRL curriculum, the idea is that all learning activities offered are there for a reason; they cover relevant learning outcomes. If anything is skipped: How will you alternatively reach the intended learning outcomes? > Reflect upon in portfolio.
-   Are you  **asking/submitting questions** before and during expert meetings, practicals, in the learning team, etc? If not, why? What is holding you back? How could you overcome this? Can you give an example of a situation in which you  _did_  ask an expert for help? How did that work out?

**5 PLANNING AND TIME MANAGEMENT**

-   Looking at your  **planning**, are you managing to stay on track? What works well, what is difficult?
-   Does your planning or  **time-management**  need adjustment? How? What do you need to make this change successful?

**6 ATTENTION FOCUSSING AND MOTIVATON**

-   **When and where**  do you study? Are you well enough able to  **focus**  your  **attention**? Do you need any adjustments to put yourself in a (more) productive study environment?
-   What about your  **motivation**: Which tasks or topics are you well motivated for? Why is that? How do you keep up that spirit? And which tasks or topics do you struggle with? Why is that? How could you overcome this?
-   When you have accomplished a task, how do or could you  **reward**  yourself?

**7 REMAINING QUESTIONS / PORTFOLIO**

-   Which **feedback**  did you already collect in this period? And what is coming up? See PIP for what is expected in this period. Are there any  **actions needed**  to receive useful feedback?
-   What  **relevant experiences**  have you encountered thus far in this period? > Create card.
-   Considering all previous points: Is there a need for  **new personal learning goals**? > Formulate and document in portfolio.
-   Don’t forget to document the topics and agreements from this meeting in an  **interview report card**  in your portfolio within one week after the meeting.



Use time to discuss learning strategies. It might be very insightful to ask your peers how they learn and exchange best practices. Tip: review Study Smart materials together.

# ⬜ 7.2.2 - Conversation guide end-of-period 1-on-1 meeting


----------

#### **Purpose of the end-of-period 1-on-1 meetings**

During a period, emphasis for 1-on-1 coaching is on the performance (“Act”) phase ([See tool 7.2.1](https://canvas.maastrichtuniversity.nl/courses/23475/pages/7-dot-2-1-conversation-guide-regular-1-on-1-meetings "🗨️ 7.2.1 - Conversation guide regular 1-on-1 meetings")). Once every period, focus changes for once with the purpose to  **round-off the previous period**. Plan these sessions well in advance (preferably in the 2nd  or 3rd  week of the next period – see also the Timeline document in EPASS). In terms of the learning cycle, focus in these meetings is on the  **self-reflection (“look back”) and forethought (“plan”) phases**. Look back and reflect on performance in terms of the APT and accompanying Performance Objectives (POs) and on competency development and the learning process; look forward to learning goals and action plans for the next period.

#### **How to use this tool**

This tool provides a  **basic structure**  and  **guiding questions**  for the  **end-of-period 1-on-1 meeting**. It includes  **topics that require attention at the end of each period**.
