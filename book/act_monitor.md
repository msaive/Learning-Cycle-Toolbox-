# 🟠 4. ACT :: I want to check my progress and adjust my plan if necessary (Monitor progress)

### **What are these tools?**

These tools help you in (1) monitoring your progress as you work through an Authentic Professional Task (APT) or any other learning task/goal by regularly assessing how well you are meeting your objectives; (2) identifying areas where your strategy may need adjustments, ensuring that you stay aligned with your goals and timeline; (3) adapting your learning plan based on new insights or changing circumstances, allowing for flexibility in your approach.

### **Why are these tools useful?**

These tools are useful for self-observation during the “Act” phase, where you put your plan into action and continuously monitor how well you are progressing toward task completion. These tools allow you to reflect on whether the strategies you initially developed are effective or if adjustments are needed to improve efficiency or overcome unexpected challenges. This ongoing reflection helps ensure that your efforts remain productive and that you are on track to meet your goals, allowing for real-time corrections and improvements.

### **When to use these tools?**

Use these tools regularly throughout the “Act” phase, especially after completing key stages of the APT or (personal) learning goal or when encountering obstacles. Regular progress checks allow you to catch potential issues early, making it easier to adapt your plan without losing drive. Revisit these tools anytime your progress stalls, if you feel the need to optimize your approach, to check whether you are not missing any aspects of the task, to meet deadlines or performance objectives more effectively.

# 🟧 4.1 - Discussing Learning Plan Progress

## **Guiding questions to discuss progress on individual learning plans**

----------

#### **How to use this tool?**

This tool can be used within the learning team and/or within 1-on-1 meetings with the LTC and/or for self-study.

**Step 1 (Monitor):** Follow the suggested questions to review and self-evaluate your individual learning plan (process and outcome).

**Step 2 (evaluate):**  In order to dig deeper and debrief your learning actions follow the STARR technique. Identify areas for improvement.

**Step 3 (adapt):**  Follow the suggested questions to adapt your plan and develop next steps.

----------

#### **Step 1 – Monitor: Questions to check state of affairs (global overview)**

· Process - review  **learning plan**:  
o **How are you**  doing/feeling?  
o **Where** are you now? > What did you manage to do according to plan, what not?  
o What  **obstacles** did you encounter? What was helpful?  
· Outcome – review  **progress information**  (feedback, (self-)assesments, etc.:  
o To what extent are you  **on track**?

-   -   -   In terms of APT and period learning progress
        -   In terms of personal learning goals

#### **Step 2 – Evaluate: Questions to evaluate actions so far (dig deeper)**

· To debrief learning actions, the STARR interviewing technique can be used:  
o (**S=Situation**: What was the context? > Where?/Who?/When?)  
> This might be less important here, because obvious.  
o **T=Task**: What were you supposed to do? What was your learning goal / plan?  
o **A=Action**: What did you actually do? How did this differ (or not) from your plan?  
o **R=Result**: How did it work? What was the outcome?  
o **R=Reflect**: How satisfied are you, about outcome and process? What to do different next time? > see next 

#### **Step 3 – Adapt: Questions to develop next steps**

· Identify what to  **continue**:  
o Ongoing activities that are going well  
o Effective study behaviours  
o Next steps conform individual learning plan for period  
o Next steps conform SMART plans for personal goals  
· Identify what to  **adapt**:  
o Plans that are behind schedule / slow on progress  
o Actions and study behaviours that did not work out as expected  
o Topics/actions that caused unforeseen problems  
· Adapt: What do  **differently** next time / what to try out / experiment with?  
o Brainstorm: You are now here… you need to get to there….  
> What will be the next step? > SMART

# 🟧 4.2 - Team Activities to Support Monitoring

## **Suggested learning team activities to support monitoring, evaluation, and adaptation of individual learning plans**

----------

#### **How to use this tool?**

This tool can be used within the learning team and/or within 1-on-1 meetings with the LTC and/or for self-study.

**Step 1 (Monitor):** Follow the suggested team activities to support your learning plan.

**Step 2 (Evaluate and Adapt):**  Choose from the suggested team activities to support your individual learning plan. Identify areas for improvement and discuss it with your team.

NB: These suggestions are just for inspiration. Be creative! (and additional suggestions are welcome)!

----------

#### **Step 1 – Monitor: within-team feedback formats**

-   **Quiz-formats**  to support  **progress monitoring**  and facilitate  **retrieval practice:**  
    (every student prepares a few questions):  
    o Collaborative create, perform and evaluate online quiz: wooclap, etc.  
    o “De slimste mens” formats:  
    - create puzzles from 3x4 table  
    - “What do you know about…”  
    o Create and exchange flashcards (tip: Anki-app:  [https://www.ankiapp.com/)](https://www.ankiapp.com/))
-   Perform and evaluate  **role plays**, e.g.:  
    o Parts of doctor-patient encounters  
    o Multidisciplinary health care meeting  
    o Clinical patient discussion (“overdracht”)  
    o Other parts of APT or POs
-   Collaborative generate and discuss “what if questions” > see also Tool 4.7
-   Use a (medical) case to apply newly gained insights to > see also Tool 4.7
-   Collaborative developing and applying peer-feedback rubrics

#### **Step 2 – Evaluate & Adapt: share & advice formats**

-   STARR  **intervision** format  
    o Students interviewing each other using STARR technique (see tool A9) on experiences with learning strategies, study planning, SMART learning goals, etc.  
    
-   **“Am I the only one….”**  
    o Share experience, ask question to group, generate multiple possible solutions or alternatives together. > Student who asked question concludes and formulates key message / advice taken.

o Brainstorm: This was not a success / did not turn out well this time  
> What try differently? How to remediate/resolve? Who can help you? > SMART  
· **Integrate** adapted plans and additions in individual learning plan
