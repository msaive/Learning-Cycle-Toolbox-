# 🔵 6. LOOK BACK :: I want to reflect and derive lessons learned

### **What are these tools?**

These tools provide (1) a set of generic guiding questions and activities that can be helpful for reflecting individually and/or in team activities about your overall experience with the Authentic Professional Task (APT) or a specific learning goal and assess whether your current study strategies were effective; (2) make informed decisions about whether to maintain your current learning approach or adapt it for the next task or goal, based on the insights gained from your performance and evaluation; (3) identify specific adjustments to improve your learning strategies for future tasks, ensuring continuous development and optimization of your study habits.

### **Why are these tools useful?**

These tools are useful to guide and assist you to reflect on your learning during the “ACT” and “LOOK BACK” steps of the learning cycle. They fit with the aims of “monitor progress” and “derive lessons learned”: to analyse and reflect on your individual learning and team activities to support it. By analysing your study approach and its effectiveness, you can determine whether to keep using the same strategies or to modify them to better suit future learning challenges. This step ensures that you carry forward valuable lessons and maintain or adapt strategies that help you grow and improve as a learner.

### **When to use these tools?**

These tools are specifically designed to be used during or at the end of the period. They can be used individually for reflection and within a learning team meeting to discuss and provide peer-support. Once you've judged how well you performed and identified the relationship between your actions and outcomes, take time to consider whether your approach was successful. Decide if you will maintain your current strategies or adapt them before starting a new learning cycle or when facing the next APT or specific learning goal. This action helps set the stage for improved performance in future tasks.
