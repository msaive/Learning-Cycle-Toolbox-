# 🔵 5. LOOK BACK :: I want to evaluate my performance and understand how my actions influenced the outcome (results and process)

### **What are these tools?**

These tools help you (1) reflect on and critically evaluate your performance in completing an Authentic Professional Task (APT) or specific learning goal, comparing the results to the goals and performance objectives (POs); (2) analyse and develop insights into how your choices, learning strategies, and adjustments throughout the task impacted the final performance.

### **Why are these tools useful?**

These tools are useful to help you assess how well you performed and how effectively you applied your learning strategies. These tools help you connect your actions to the outcomes, fostering a deeper understanding of what contributed to your success or areas where you fell short. By evaluating your performance and learning process in relation to your initial goals, you will be able to identify strenghts, areas for improvement and lessons to apply in future tasks in the next step.

### **When to use these tools?**

These tools are specifically designed to be used at the end of a learning cycle or after completing a significant portion of an APT. Once you have finished the task or reached a major milestone, take time to reflect on your performance, compare it to your goals, and analyse how your strategies and decisions influenced the results.

#### **End-of-period questions (evaluate APT, POs and personal learning goals)**

-   Review performance objectives and  **progress**  made:
    -   Where are you now? To what level did you grow during this period?
    -   Are you performing as expected? What evidence supports this?
-   For  **difficult / below**  **standard**  POs:
    -   What feedback did you receive? What is the problem?
    -   How could you remediate? > Make SMART goal
-   Review  **personal learning goals**:
    -   Where are you now? To what level did you grow during this period?
    -   Are you satisfied? Did you reach the level you aimed for?
    -   How to continue with this learning goal?
        -   Finish > If aim is reached and consolidated
        -   Continue > Define next step
        -   Adapt > Reformulate learning goal
    -   Look back at  **learning process**  and  **learning strategies**:
        -   What worked well / are you satisfied with? > continue
        -   What to do differently next period? How? > Make SMART goal

#### **Competence analysis questions**

-   Look  **forward**:
    -   What will you be working on in next period? What do you aim for? > Define milestones
    -   Will these aims need learning goals to reach them? > Define SMART

#### **Substantiated analysis questions (end-of-year)**

For competency X:

-   How did you  **develop** during this academic year? Where are you now?
    -   Summarize milestones
    -   Refer to Framework Medical Education 2022
    -   Underpin your statements with evidence
-   What are your  **strong points**?
