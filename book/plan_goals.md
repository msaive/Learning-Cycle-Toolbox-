# ⚫ 2. PLAN :: I want to set clear learning goals and make a feasible plan

### **What are these tools?**

The goalsetting tools help you clearly define your own specific learning goals for the period (in addition to the learning goals that you will encounter anyway as part of the curriculum and learning tasks). Strategic planning tools provide support in devising actionable steps to achieve your goals effectively.

### **Why are these tools useful?**

These tools are crucial for setting specific learning goals and creating a strategy to achieve them. By providing a structured approach, they ensure that your goals are well aligned with both the APT and your personal development needs. They also offer guidance on how to devise a clear, concrete and feasible plan for addressing and actually achieving your learning goals efficiently.

### **When to use these tools?**

The goalsetting tools should be used right after task analysis and before diving into specific learning tasks or activities. These tools are ideal for working within a learning team to derive collective learning goals and a planning for your team meetings, but can also be used individually to find your personal focus points for the upcoming period. These tools can also be revisited throughout the learning process, especially when refining your approach to next focus-APTs or adjusting your learning plan during the “Act” stage.

----------

#### **Step 1: Questions to debrief exploration**

-   Do you  **understand**  the APT and POs?
    -   What is unclear?
-   What is your  **personal feeling**  about this task?
    -   What do  _you_ expect to be (not) enjoyable / interesting / exciting / …. / about it?
    -   What are  _you_  looking forward to? / What are  _you_  afraid of? Why?
-   How did you  **experience**  the concept mapping activity?
    -   What did you know / not know?
    -   How was your contribution, compared to peers?

#### **Step 2: Review your portfolio**

-   Have a look at your portfolio: Which  **personal learning goals**  do you bring from previous periods? Which overarching learning goals (defined in Substantiated Analysis) are you working on? Can be about  _any_ of the competences, can be large or small

#### **Step 3: Questions to set personal goals**

-   Which  **“gaps”**  did you discover regarding your own knowledge/skills/attitude?
-   Which aspects/topics spark your  **interest**, enthusiasm? (positive association)
-   Which aspects/topics do you dislike or anticipate  **difficulty**  with? (negative association)
-   Which  **pitfalls**  do you see? Examples:
    -   From positive association: spending too much time, neglecting other areas
    -   From negative association: neglecting or postponing
-   Which goals are most important? >  **Prioritize**  and create a realistic list

----------

#### **Step 1: From goal to “doable” action plan (SMART)**

-   **S=Specific**: Make goals and action plans clear and concrete
    -   Exactly  _what_  do you want to achieve? And  _why?_
    -   _What_  are you  _exactly_  going to do to reach your goal?
        -   Explore learning tasks, materials and activities > make choices
        -   Define concrete steps in an action plan; state details of  _how, when_ and  _where_.
        -   Large or “clouded” learning goals: What will be  _first_  step?
-   **M=Measurable**: How can you check progress on your learning goal?
    -   -   _Which_  results do you aim for, and  _when_?
        -   Include intermediate  _checkpoints_  to monitor your progress.
-   **A=Actionable/Attainable**: Make sure circumstances and opportunities are right to work on this learning goal. What do you need to really make this happen?
-   **R=Realistic / Relevant**: Are your learning goals realistic?
-   -   -   Also: is it inspiring / meaningful / challenging to  _you_?
-   **T=Time-bound**: Set a start date and deadline, and hold yourself accountable to stick to it.

#### **Step 2: Follow up on your learning goals**

-   Provide  **regular updates**  about the progress of your learning goal in your portfolio. You can do this either in the Learning Goal form, or on an experience or competency card, whatever fits best in your portfolio practice.
    -   Include a decision on how to proceed:
        -   Close learning goal if goal is reached and consolidated
        -   Continue if goal is not yet reached / you want to keep working on it
        -   Close and adjust if needed (see next bullet)
-   Adjust your learning goals if needed. Adjustment can be needed when:
-   -   -   You have  **finished a first step**  of a large learning goal
            -   Close current goal and define new one for next step
        -   **Circumstances have changed**  since you first defined the learning goal
            -   Close current learning goal and redefine your aim as a new goal to make it better fit your current situation
        -   The goal is still relevant to you, but the action plan you first defined  **appears not to work**  out as you hoped for
            -   Keep current learning goal, but in update redefine action plan.

# ⬛ 2.1.3 - Examples SMART Learning Goals

## **Not to copy  but to inspire your  _own_ learning goals**

----------

#### **How to use this tool?**

This tool is designed to inspire and guide you in creating your own learning goals. Here, you'll find fictitious examples showcasing the SMART criteria in action. Remember, the purpose is not to copy these examples, but rather to use them as inspiration for crafting your own unique and personally relevant learning goals.

For goal setting guide >  [See Tool 2.1.1](https://canvas.maastrichtuniversity.nl/courses/23475/pages/2-dot-1-1-goalsetting-guiding-questions "⬛ 2.1.1 - Goalsetting guiding questions")  
For SMART learning goals >  [See Tool 2.1.2](https://canvas.maastrichtuniversity.nl/courses/23475/pages/2-dot-1-2-smart-learning-goals "⬛ 2.1.2 - SMART Learning Goals")

----------

#### **Example 1: Improve literature search skills for studying learning tasks**

_This is an example of a well-documented learning goal for a complex skill, with multiple steps._

-   **S=Specific**: I will improve my literature search skills by using library resources (e-books, papers) instead of websites or summaries. I will do this for every learning task for 3 weeks.
    

Step 1: I will use the course resource list to find relevant e-books.

Step 2: I will do the library e-module on literature searches

Step 3: I will practice my skills by performing my own database searches to find 1 paper for each learning task.

Step 4: I will ask for feedback from 2 peers and my coach about my references and resources used.

-   **M=Measurable**: I will measure my success from the feedback from my coach and peers who I have asked to provide a subjective comment about the search conducted and the resources I used.
    
-   **A=Actionable/Attainable**: The library offers online resources as well as books, which I have not used much so far. There are lists of recommended resources available on Canvas, which is a good starting point. Furthermore, the library website contains an e-module how to search literature in databases which I can use to learn to perform my own searches.
    
-   **R=Realistic / Relevant**: Improving my literature search skills will help me as a medical doctor to find reliable and up-to-date information faster.
    
-   **T=Time-bound**: I have set the end of period feedback round as a milestone.
    

#### **Example 2: Type at 60 words per minute**

_This is an example of a “technical” learning goal with sufficient detail (nonmedical domain)_

-   **S=Specific**: I will learn to type at 60 words per minute on my laptop within 3 months by practicing 5 times a week for 30 minutes.
    
-   **M=Measurable**: I can measure my progress with one of the many free tests on the internet that are available to measure typing speed.
    
-   **A=Actionable/Attainable**: My current typing is not bad (almost blind, but with typo errors and speed around 45). I have time to schedule 30 minutes of practice 5 times a week in the evenings.
    
-   **R=Realistic / Relevant**: Being more efficient in typing will save me a lot of time in future study assignments and work-related writing tasks.
    
-   **T=Time-bound**: I want to improve my speed by 5 per month for the next three months (oct-nov-dec).
    

#### **Example 3: Studying discipline X for 4 days a week for 5 weeks**

_This is an example of a study behaviour learning goal_

-   **S=Specific**: I will study discipline X for one hour 4 days a week (mon-tue-thur-fri) for 5 weeks. I will practice during my train ride from university to home. I will create and use flash cards to practice this content.
    
-   **M=Measurable**: I will log my activities (time spent, number of flash cards practiced) in a diary on my smartphone. On my next progress test I aim to achieve a + score for this discipline (current score -).
    
-   **A=Actionable/Attainable**: I can do this while I am traveling.
    
-   **R=Realistic / Relevant**: This extra effort should help me reach a better score for this topic on the next progress test.
    
-   **T=Time-bound**: This goal will be completed in 5 weeks when the next progress test takes place.
    

#### **Example 4: Improving self-confidence in presenting**

_This is an example of a seemingly less concrete aim._

-   **S=Specific**: I will develop confidence to do our upcoming end-of-period presentation in front of the whole cohort of students and some teachers, by practicing from note cards. I will practice alone in front of a mirror and with two peers presents for the next 2 weeks.
    
-   **M=Measurable**: I will consider this learning goal accomplished successfully when I will be able to perform the presentation slowly, fluently and without panicking in front of everyone in 2 weeks.
    
-   **A=Actionable/Attainable**: I can do this, as my peers are able to do this as well. It is not that I do not understand the presentation content, and I know what I am supposed to do (skills); it is a psychological barrier that I need to pass, and I am confident that I can make it with the help of my two friends who will assist me and whom I trust.
    
-   **R=Realistic / Relevant**: Gaining confidence in presenting is something I need for my professional future and I want to get over my reluctance very much since that feeling is holding me back.
    
-   **T=Time-bound**: The final presentation takes place 2 weeks from now.

        -   What comes first regarding your learning plan for this period?
        -   What is the first personal learning goal (step) to work on?
-   Next, work out a detailed week schedule for this and next week(s):
-   Which concrete activities will you undertake? How much time do they cost?
    -   -   Scheduled activities: what takes place when? > Add to schedule
        -   Subscription activities: what timeslot fits best for you? > Register and add to schedule
        -   Self-study activities > Add to schedule
        -   Monitoring and assessment activities > Add to schedule
-   Review your schedule (together with a peer or your coach)
    -   -   Did you forget anything?
        -   Are scheduled times realistic?
        -   Add some buffer time to account for setbacks

-   Let’s go!  **😊**

# ⬛ 2.3 - Make a Team Plan for a Period

## **Actions to develop a team plan for a curriculum period**


----------

#### **How to use this tool?**

Learning teams create their own planning for a period. This tool provides directions to get started and how to refine your planning as the period progressed. Some examples of what a planning document may look like, are also given.

**Step 1:** At the beginning of the period, before the first learning team meeting, browse through the course materials, and note major events and deadlines. Bring your notes to the learning team meeting.

**Step 2:** During the first learning team meeting, develop an outline plan for the whole period and a more specific plan for the first focus-APT.

**Step 3:**  Review and refine the plan as you go through the period, for subsequent focus-APTs..

For a guideline to develop your own personal learning plan >  [See Tool 2.2.1](https://canvas.maastrichtuniversity.nl/courses/23475/pages/2-dot-2-1-develop-individual-learning-plan "⬛ 2.2.1 - Develop Individual Learning Plan")

----------

#### **Step 1: Explore period information and list important dates and events**

**_Before_** _the first learning team_  meeting of the new period, browse the course information on Canvas on your own. Take note of the following details and bring them, to save time during the learning team meeting.

-   What are prescheduled  **deadlines and milestones**?
    -   Assignments, mandatories
    -   Prescheduled moments to collect progress information > See period information plan
-   When do  **focus-APTs**  start?
-   When are deadlines to submit questions for  **expert meetings**?

#### **Step 2: Create an outline plan**

-   Create a  **shared document**  (in OneDrive or Google Docs); make it a  **table**. See below for template/example (filled with fictive data).
    -   Insert  **rows**  for each learning team meeting
    -   Insert  **columns**:
        -   major events & deadlines
        -   expert meetings (submission date)
    -   Feel free to  **add other columns**  as you see fit / useful, for example, to divide roles and tasks:
        -   Chair
        -   Scribe

-   Fill in meeting details for the  **current focus-APT**  only:
    -   Start by browsing and prediscuss the  **learning tasks**.
    -   Create an inventory of  **learning goals**  and  **topics**  to discuss.
    -   **Prioritise**,  **order**  and  **spread**  topics over meetings.
    -   Choose  **formats/activities**  to work on these topics:  **See tool 7.1** (How to structure a Learning Team Meeting) for suggestions.
-   **Starters’ tip:**  To overcome “starting paralysis” specify the plan for next one or twee meetings only, get going and refine from there based on your experiences.
-   **Review** your plan together with your coach:
    -   Did you forget anything? (monitoring activities, team dynamics evaluation!)
    -   Are scheduled plans realistic?
    -   Add some buffer time to account for setbacks!
-   Add, adapt and refine your plan as you progress through the period.

#### **Real-life examples**

Below, you can find several screenshots from plannings from actual learning teams, created in previous years. To serve as examples and inspirations. Note that these examples differ greatly; there is not one way to go, so find out what works best for your team!

Let’s go!  **😊**
