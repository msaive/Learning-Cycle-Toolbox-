# 🚩 Learning Cycle Toolbox :: Starting point

### **What is the learning cycle toolbox?**

The learning cycle toolbox is designed to support the learning process in the bachelor of medicine. The tools match the different phases and steps in the learning cycle. In addition, the toolbox includes tools to help you structure your learning team meetings and 1-on-1 coaching sessions and to facilitate group dynamics evaluation in your learning team. Tools are designed to be brief and practical, so no long reads.

### **Why should I use the toolbox?**

In the bachelor of medicine, there is a strong emphasis on self-regulated learning (SRL). However, self-regulation of learning is not always easy. It is a complex process, with several steps and skills involved. We are all different in the SRL skills we are already strong at and the points we (still) find difficult. This toolbox is designed to provide fit-for-purpose support for specific steps. Because we all can use a helping hand somewhere.  
Furthermore, the toolbox provides meeting guides and evaluation tools. These are important to optimise group sessions and the interactions with (other) students and the learning team coach. As an important part of the learning environment, safe and open interactions are essential for effective (self-regulated) learning.

### **When to use this toolbox?**

You may want to consult the toolbox when looking for help or inspiration on a specific step in the learning cycle or for suggestions on how to handle a specific meeting type. The tools can be helpful for students when working individually, but can also be used to guide interactions within your learning team or during 1-on-1 meetings between student and coach.

### **How to find the right tool?**

The 2-slide infographic below shows the learning cycle. At the core of the cycle are the three phases “Plan”, “Act” and “Look back”. Each phase consists of two steps, each involving a specific skillset. The tools are categorized according to these steps. Use the interactive thumbnails to explore the phases, steps and skillsets. As a student, you might wonder  _"How can I improve my....?";_  as a coach you might be looking for  _"How can I stimulate.... in my learning team or in individual students?"_  In the toolbox, you can find tools for the learning cycle as a whole and for each of the learning cycle steps. Two additional entries lead to the meeting guides and evaluation tools.
