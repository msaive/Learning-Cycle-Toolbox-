# 1. PLAN :: I want to analyse a task

### **What are these tools?**

These tools provide support for the task analysis step of the learning process and provide structured guidance for analysing any  _Authentic Professional Task_  (APT) by breaking it down into key components. In addition, creating a concept map will help you to see “the big picture” of a period.

### **Why are these tools useful?**

These tools are essential for gaining a clear understanding of a new APT during the task analysis phase. They align with the goals of this step, which include thoroughly analysing the APT, which is the foundation for setting achievable and specific learning goals later. By providing structure, they help ensure that your goals are aligned with both the overall APT, any specific focus-APTs and/or your personal competency development needs. Additionally, they provide a clear path for navigating and addressing APTs and personal points for growth efficiently. Moreover, creating an overview of the APT through a concept map provides you with a personal scaffold/overview that you can easily refer to (and elaborate or change) later in the period.

### **When to use these tools?**

The task analysis tools should be used at the beginning of a new learning cycle or period when a new APT is introduced. These tools are ideal for working within a learning team to discuss and analyse the new APT comprehensively, but can also be used individually to find your personal focus points for the upcoming period. This analysis should come before setting specific learning goals and strategies for learning tasks.

----------

#### **How to use this tool?**

**Step 1:** Before the learning team meeting, review the APT. One student prepares and chairs the group discussion during the meeting while other student(s) take note to share and contribute to the group brainstorm. Customize or add new questions as necessary for your APT. Engage in a comprehensive discussion of the APT using the below questions. (Do not forget to rotate responsibilities for question selection among team members. Ensure everyone gets a chance to contribute to and lead discussions.)

  
**Step 2:**  After the discussion share your feelings about the APT using the provided questions. Collect feedback after each session to enhance the effectiveness of APT discussions and adjust the process according to the team's needs.  
  

**Step 3:**  After the learning team meeting, review the guiding questions for yourself. Use your answers as input for your personal goals and learning plan for this period, and to discuss with your learning team coach during your next 1-on-1meeting.

----------

#### **Step 1: Questions to develop a first  _understanding_  of what the task entails and what is expected at the end of the period**

· Look up the  **performance objectives**  (POs) in Canvas (module “Performance Objectives” or in the Performance Information Plan).  
· What do the performance objectives (POs) say?  
o Do you understand the wording? What is unclear?  
o Do you understand the contents? What is unclear?  
o Which competencies are involved?  
· What does this PO have to do with the  **whole task**  (APT)?  
o How does it relate?  
o What is its importance?  
· **Focus-APTs:**  
o What are similarities / differences between the focus-APTs?  
o Why were these focus area’s chosen? What is the logic behind it?  
· What is/are the  **central theme(s)**  in this APT?  
o How are the  **longitudinal tracks**  embedded in this APT?  
o Where do you recognize aspects of critical professional / professional & personal development?  
· How far should we go?  
o What topics or content is explicitly  **excluded / beyond the scope**  of this period?  
o What  **variations** are  **included** in the scope of this period?

#### **Step 2: Questions to develop a feeling for the Authentic Professional Task (APT)**

· Why is this task  **relevant**?  
o What is an example of such a situation?  
· **When / for whom**  is this task relevant?  
o What function does this task have within the medical profession?  
o Who are involved? > What perspectives can be distinguished?  
o What is an example of the …. perspective?  
· What is your  **personal feeling**  about this task?  
o What do you expect to be (not) enjoyable / interesting / exciting / …. / about it?  
o What are you looking forward to? / What are you afraid of? Why?  
· How does this task fit into  **your vision**  for the future?

# ⬛ 1.2 - APT–Mapping

## **Concept mapping as a technique to explore and navigate the APT**

----------

_The PDF of this tool can be downloaded here:_
[1.2 - Plan - APT mapping v4.0.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/25229458/1.2.-.Plan.-.APT.mapping.v4.0.pdf)

----------

**How to use this tool?**  
This tool can be used within the learning team and/or for self-study. It can be used to explore an overarching APT.

**Step 1:** After group exploring of the APT (see  [tool 1.1](https://canvas.maastrichtuniversity.nl/courses/23475/pages/1-dot-1-apt-analysis "⬛ 1.1 - APT Analysis")), follow the provided questions for brainstorming and navigation. Customize or add new questions as necessary for your APT. Engage in a comprehensive discussion of the APT using the below questions. (Do not forget to rotate responsibilities for question selection among team members. Ensure everyone gets a chance to contribute to and lead discussions.)  
  
**Step 2:**  During or after the discussion, use the whiteboard or one of the online platforms to create your concept map (individually/in smaller group/whole group)

----------

#### **Step 1: APT-mapping basic steps and to explore**

-   Start with a general question:  **What do you know about**… [this APT]?  
    o Put central concept in middle of map
-   Brainstorm concepts  
    o Organize  **main concepts**  in the map around central concept  
    o Organize  **sub concepts**  around main concepts  
    o Use  **POs**  and  **focus-APTs**  for initial input
-   Find connections  
    o Indicate connections between central – main – sub concepts with  **lines**  
    o **Arrows** indicating directs of relationships  
    o **Annotate** arrows with words or symbols indicating type of relationship
-   Identify  **blind spots**  and gaps  
    o Use creating an APT-map for self-assessment  
    o Use the APT-map to identify areas for study
-   To facilitate development of  **learning plans**:  
    o When analysing overarching APT: Indicate in APT-map areas of each focus-APT

The overarching APT-map can further be used to  **zoom in / zoom out**  of focus-APTs >  [See tool 3.1](https://canvas.maastrichtuniversity.nl/courses/23475/pages/3-dot-1-focus-apt-zoom-in-slash-zoom-out " 🟧 3.1 - Focus-APT Zoom In/Zoom Out")

#### **Step 2: Concept mapping platforms**
